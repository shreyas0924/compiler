# C Compiler Project

## Overview
This project is a C compiler that translates C source code into executable output. It consists of a frontend built with React for the user interface and a backend powered by Node.js to handle the compilation process. With this compiler, you can write C code, submit it through the user-friendly web interface, and receive the compiled output.

## Features
- **C Code Compilation**: Write C code in the provided editor, and our compiler will generate executable output.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The frontend is built with React, offering an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Fast Compilation**: Utilizes Node.js on the backend for efficient and speedy compilation.
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages for easy debugging of code.
